Paste text of any length into the text box, click "Extract ICD-10 codes," and let the Codester do his thing!

All ICD-10 codes will be extracted from the text and displayed in the bottom text box. Only valid ICD-10 codes will be displayed, not just terms that match the formatting. For example, "B12" matches ICD-10 code formatting but is not a code and thus would not be extracted.

The "Copy codes to clipboard" button will copy the list in the text box output to your clipboard.

This code was built on a Windows PC and has not been tested on other operating systems.
